      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Gordon Scott Leaver. I'm a 14 year old kid enrolled in Keefe Tech Highschool.<br> I've been able to go back recently, but only for my shop, which I choose as Programming and Web Development.<br> I have a lot of different things I do in my freetime, some of my favorites are but not limited to:</p>


      <ul>
        <li>Doing Fencing, Fencing is quite a lot of fun, being able to beat your opponent attacks and parry them as you<br> try to get a hit on them. I currently take Fencing Classes at Zeta Fencing in Natick, and have enjoyed myself so far.<br>

        <li>Playing Videogames, Videogames are a lot of fun, it can be great to just hop into a fantasy world and run around.<br> Some of my favorites include Celeste, Spelunky 2, and Minecraft.<br>

        <li>Reading Books, I'm not exactly a bookworm, but I do still enjoy staying up a bit at night to continue reading books.<br> Now, there are of course a few genres I don't like, (<i>Cough Cough Teen Romance Comedy Dramas Cough Cough</i>)<br> but some genres I do especially enjoy, such as fantasy or mystery.<br>

        <li>Rollerblading, this isn't exactly something I do, but it is something I've been wanting to get into for a while now,<br> it seems a lot of fun, maybe for my birthday this year I'll get a cheap pair, I've only used them once when I was<br> visiting my relatives in California.<br>

        <li>Sleeping. Everyone needs sleep, and it feels great, I'd consider it a hobby, taking a nap after a run, etc.<br>

          <td>Reddit is a social media website, split up in to hundreds of thousands of different categories<br> with their own communities, allowing them to make forum posts for that community,<br> it's great because you can easily connect to people who like what you like, and give rewards<br> or upvote them to give them reputation.</td>

          <td>Discord is sort of like Reddit in a sense, except the different communties are actually servers<br> with different text channels and voice channels to communicate, with advance permisions<br> with different roles, different permissions, different bots, and most importantly it's <br>invite only to that server.</td>

          <td>Google, everyone knows it, and it's ever so useful for browing the web, you can go to youtube<br> owned by google, send emails with gmail, and so much more. Just how like I'm doing a<br> assignment from Google Classroom!</td>

      <h2>High School Information</h2>
      <p>As I said before, I go to Keefe Tech Highschool. It's a great place with there being two alternating schedules,<br> a "A Week" and a "B Week". During our A week, we have our normal classes, Math, English, Spanish, Social Studies, etc.<br> And then on B week, we have shop for half of the day, and then our last 3 academic blocks. Though today<br> is the one week I'm allowed to go into school in person, (<i>Corona Bleh</i>) so I have shop for the entire day.<br> Programming and Web Development is a really fun shop for me, I've always been programming for a<br> couple of years in other languages then html and I find it quite fun, though I hope we learn more advance concepts soon.</p><br>
